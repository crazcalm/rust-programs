<p>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.</p>
<p>An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.</p>
<p>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>(()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
))((((( also results in floor 3.
()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.
</code></pre>
<p>To what floor do the instructions take Santa?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts"><a class="header" href="#thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>This is a warm up problem, so there is not much to think about, but I did appreciate the opportunity to think about the process I want to use to solve these problems. I just finished reading The C Programming Language book and the small commandline programs they built throughout that book was eye opening. So, for my solutions, I will pass the input to my programs via stdin.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut floor = 0;

    for line in io::stdin().lines() {
        for character in line.unwrap().chars() {
            if character.eq(&amp;'(') {
                floor += 1;
            } else if character.eq(&amp;')') {
                floor -= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    println!("Floor {}", floor);
}</code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="the-problem-part-2"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-part-2">The Problem Part 2</a></h2>
<p>Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so on.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.
()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.
</code></pre>
<p>What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-1"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-1">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>This took me by surprise! I had already started working on day 2. I actually saw that day 2 has a part 2 before I realized that day one had a part 2.</p>
<p>At first glance, this problem looks like it is just about counting the characters I see and reporting when the floor hits -1. In the spirit of unix and in the aim of learning to let go of code, I will create a new project for this.</p>

<p>The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.</p>
<p>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-2"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-2">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>For this problem, I wanted to play around with variable initialization. I couldn't get the <code>collect</code> call to return the just the three values in like a tuple that I could distribute to individual variables, so I settled on putting it into a Vec and separating them later.</p>
<p>The <code>side</code> variables are meh. I could have done something more fancy with them, but I was tired and it didn't seem worth it. The <code>extra</code> variable initialization though! I like that one. I rarely use random code block at all in my code, but using it like this to initialize a semi complicated variable lets me see the power of these blocks!</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::io;

    let mut wrapping_paper = 0;

            temp.sort();

<p>The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they would again like to be exact.</p>
<p>The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2+2+3+3 = 10 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 2<em>3</em>4 = 24 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of 34 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 1+1+1+1 = 4 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 1<em>1</em>10 = 10 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of 14 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many total feet of ribbon should they order?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-3"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-3">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>I made this problem extremely annoying by trying to be fancy. If you put all the sides into an Vec and sort it, then the first two entries will be the smaller two sides. That is straight forward. Another thing that should have been straight forward is getting the cubed size. All you have to do is multiple <code>dimension[0] * dimension[1] * dimension[2]</code>, but no. I wanted to be fancy and use <code>reduce</code>.</p>
<p>Fun fact. If you are iterating over a Vec, then you have access to references of the elements. If you call reduce on a Vec of references, then Rust expects you to deal with references in your reduce. I don't want to deal with references. As such, it took me 10 minutes to figure out that I had to use <code>map</code> to make non-reference copies of the elements of the Vec before calling reduce.</p>
<p>All in all, being fancy was stupid. Next time just mupltiple the items together...</p>

<p>Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.</p>
<p>He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and tells him where to move next. Moves are always exactly one house to the north (^), south (v), east (&gt;), or west (&lt;). After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.</p>
<p>However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once. How many houses receive at least one present?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_&gt; delivers presents to 2 houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>^&gt;v&lt; delivers presents to 4 houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>^v^v^v^v^v delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only 2 houses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="thoughts-4"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-4">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>If you treat the directions as 2d grid coordinates and then put the seen coordinates into a set, you are pretty much done. The only part I was confused about was whether or not I would make the borrow checker angry by passing my varaibles (that I still plan on using) to the HashSet. Upon reviewing the Rust Book, I performed a "<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy">Stack-Only Data Copy</a>", which means that, for integers that exist entirely on the stack, a copy is made when you assign them to another variable leaving both variable valid.</p>

<p>^v delivers presents to 3 houses, because Santa goes north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>^&gt;v&lt; now delivers presents to 3 houses, and Santa and Robo-Santa end up back where they started.</p>

<p>During my first pass at it, I put all the code in main. Though the answer was right, the repetition of code within the if blocks was hurting my eyes. So I pulled that code out into its own function. At the end of the day it is the same code, but the function of all reference does give the impression that I know what I am doing. hahaha</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-3"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-3">The Problem</a></h2>
<p>Santa needs help mining some AdventCoins (very similar to bitcoins) to use as gifts for all the economically forward-thinking little girls and boys.</p>
<p>To do this, he needs to find MD5 hashes which, in hexadecimal, start with at least five zeroes. The input to the MD5 hash is some secret key (your puzzle input, given below) followed by a number in decimal. To mine AdventCoins, you must find Santa the lowest positive number (no leading zeroes: 1, 2, 3, ...) that produces such a hash.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your secret key is abcdef, the answer is 609043, because the MD5 hash of abcdef609043 starts with five zeroes (000001dbbfa...), and it is the lowest such number to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your secret key is pqrstuv, the lowest number it combines with to make an MD5 hash starting with five zeroes is 1048970; that is, the MD5 hash of pqrstuv1048970 looks like 000006136ef....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your puzzle input is <code>iwrupvqb</code>.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-6"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-6">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>I took a brief look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5 Wiki page</a> and no obvious ways to force my wanted output jumped out at me, so I think I am going to go with the brute force approach. In the largest example, it looked like it was a little over a million MD5 computations (assuming that you start from 1).</p>

<p>I was right in that brute force was the way to go, but it was also wrong of me to do this problem while tired. I made so many little mistakes that it became frustrating. For example, I miss read the problem and thought that I had to submit the MD5 hash digest as the answer. One nice thing I can say is that even in my tired state, I had to good sense to take input from stdin. By putting the example keys and my key in a file I was able to solve all three problems at once, which allowed me to verify the examples while solving the problem for my input.</p>
<p>Anyway, <code>md5::compute</code> returns the <code>digest</code>, but it doesn't implement the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html">Display Trait</a> or have a single method to give me back the Hash in string form. I luckily noticed that it implemented the Debug Trait and that the debug string was the has I wanted. Though, I did look at their implementation for the Debug Trait and it look like it converted the digest to LowerHex before so that it could use the LowerHex fmt method to produce the string.... Wait... LowerHex is a standard library type... I was suppose to convert the digest to my wanted type and then do what I wanted to it.</p>
<p>I am going try doing that and see if it cleans up the code a bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was still wrong. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.LowerHex.html">LowerHex</a> is a trait used for formatting strings. The full mapping of formatting trait shorcuts can be found <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html#formatting-traits">here</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, the change to the code was small. Now, I am using the LowerHex formatter instead of the Debug formatter. Though this makes my code a little cleaner, both traits were using the same fmt code under the hood, so its all kind of pointless...</p>

<p>Now find one that starts with six zeroes.</p>

<p>I was going to go to bed, but I this seems like the exact same problem as the first. so I am going to take a crack at it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>They got me. The wording is different between part 1 and part 2. In part 1 it was "at least five zeros" and now it is "starts with six zeros", which means that if it starts with seven zeros, its is not correct! Given that I now have to care about the value that comes after the six zeros, I moved to using regex. The regex that I am currently using is <code>^0{6}[a-zA-Z1-9]</code>, but I am pretty sure this is overkill because hexidecimal is a-f and 0-9. Plus, I am explicitly setting it to LowerHex, which means that I do not have to care about the A-F.</p>

<p>Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.</p>
<p>A nice string is one with all of the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.</li>
<li>It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).</li>
<li>It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-8"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-8">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>This sounds like a one pass scan of the word with various check. For example, the first check is the vowels, so you add a set of vowels and check the current character against it and count the positive hits.</p>
<p>The second condition is two character condition. If you are iterating over the input one character at a time, it makes sense to use index 0 to set the first <code>prev_char</code> and then use the pair of the previous character and the current character to check this condition (Must remember to update <code>prev_char</code>).</p>
<p>The third condition has a similar setup to the second condition, but it is a "not containt", which means means that we can use this for early termination (ie, continue to the next input, but we don't have to. This could just be a flag as well).</p>
<p>On the face of it, this seems pretty straight forward. Lets try to write it up.</p>

<p>It was actually that straight forward. The only new insight I had while writing it up is that the <code>prev_char</code> is easier to handle as a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html">Option</a> because I could then use a match statement to handle all of the stuff linked to <code>prev_char</code> in one place.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-part-2-3"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-part-2-3">The Problem Part 2</a></h2>
<p>Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).</li>
<li>It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (qj) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (zxz).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>xxyxx is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>uurcxstgmygtbstg is naughty because it has a pair (tg) but no repeat with a single letter between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ieodomkazucvgmuy is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (odo), but no pair that appears twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many strings are nice under these new rules?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-9"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-9">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>I agree that the first set of ruls was ridiculous, but I am not sure I am a fan of the new rules...</p>
<p>The first rules is tricky beause they cannot overlap. For example, if I kept a hashmap of each pair of a string, then <code>aaa</code> would count as 2 pairs. And <code>aaaa</code> should count as 2 pairs, but how do you know that they are not overlapping? You cannot split them by even and odd indices because the first pair may be one an even index while the second pair is on an odd index.</p>
<p>I am going to have to continue thinking about this.</p>
<p>The second condition is more straight forward. It is asking if the current character is equal to the character that appeared 2 indices ago. That is only slightly different than the <code>prev_char</code> in part 1. In thoery, you can use the <code>prev_char</code> result to setup a match for <code>prev_prev_char</code> and then do the check there (LOL). I'll probably write it up that way because thinking about it makes me giggle.</p>
<p>Alright, I need to figure out rule 1.</p>
<p>What do I know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know I can use a hashmap to do a seen check on the pairs.</li>
<li>I also know that the "no overlap" is currently an issue that I need to overcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do I prevent overlap?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I could have a second hashmap to keep track of the indices? For example, take
<code>xyxy</code>. When we see <code>xy</code> for the first time, one hashmap will keep a count seens, which will get set to one and the other will keep an array of indices where this has been seen (current entry being (0,1)). Then, when the second <code>xy</code> comes along, we can check the hashmap to array first and verify that the previous <code>xy</code> has different indices before sending it to the hashmap count to up the count. Though I think this will work, it sounds like too much work for this problem..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an overlap to exist, the previous char must be equal to the current char, right? Maybe I can take advantage of that. I can keep track of the <code>prev_char</code> and the <code>prev_prev_char</code>. If <code>prev_prev_char</code> is None, and the <code>prev_char</code> is <code>a</code>... I might need a <code>prev_prev_prev_char</code> for this so that I have 4 chars that I can compare against because if all 4 are <code>a</code>, then we have <code>aaa</code> and that is fine. If we have <code>None, aaa</code>, then we know we have overlap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The seconds approach sounds more straight forward, but only of you have the chars on an array where you can use the index to explicitly previous chars...</p>
<p>I guess that makes sense. I can convert the line to an Vec<chars> and then iterate over the Vec. I will have access to the index and for rule 2, I can check to if index i and index i-2 are the same char. For rule one, if the current char and the previous char are equal, then I can check the two character before that and if they are all eqal, it is not an overlap.</p>
<p>I think this will work. Let me try writing it up.</p>

<p>That actually went much smoother than I expected it to go! When writing it up, I realized that I did not need the first index of the <code>vec_chars</code>, so I created a slice of it that goes from index 1 to the end and iterated over that. This meant that I could note use <code>enumerate</code> to manage the index for me, which was fine.</p>
<p>I then used a match statement to manage the different cases that I was talking about before for rule 1. If the index is 1, then there are only 2 chars so overlap is not possible. If the index is 2, then there are 3 chars. Overlap is now possible, so you have to make sure that all three chars are not the same value (Note: I think I wrote the case compliment if statements because it is easier for me to think about when I want to act as appose to when I don't want to act, but I probably could have gotten away with a simpler conditional if I did it the other way... I may change it...). If the index is 3, then there are 4 chars which means that have to check the <code>aaaa</code> and <code>baaa</code> cases.</p>
<p>One thing that is cool about the HashMap is that we have the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.entry">Entry API</a>, which allows me to create an entry counter in one line via defining what I want to happen for new entry and what I want to happen for existing entries.</p>
<p>With regard to Rust, I can say that today was the first time I used the <code>any</code> method that is defined for iterators. It is pretty cool and useful that that HashMap <code>values</code> method returns a type (The the is Values) that implements and iterator.</p>
<p>Note: I updated the <code>match</code> index == 2 <code>if</code> check. It is much easier to read now.</p>

<p>Because your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has mailed you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting configuration.</p>
<p>Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at 0,0, 0,999, 999,999, and 999,0. The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs. Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.</p>
<p>To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>toggle 0,0 through 999,0 would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>turn off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-10"><a class="header" href="#thoughts-10">Thoughts</a></h3>
<p>This seems like a mini parser... We have strings like <code>turn on 0,0 through 999,999</code>, which are <code>&lt;command&gt; &lt;start_coordinates&gt; through &lt;end_coordinates&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I don't think I want to write a parser though, so lets split the words up by white space.</p>
<p>Command:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn on</li>
<li>turn off</li>
<li>toggle</li>
</ul>
<p>The coordindates can be split by <code>,</code> to get the x and y.</p>
<p>I need to think about th lights situation. I am thinking about making them an enum.</p>
<p>Enum:</p>
<ul>
<li>on</li>
<li>off</li>
</ul>
<p>Enum Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn on</li>
<li>tun off</li>
<li>toggle</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the grid will be a 2 dimensional Vec filled with my enums. I can iterate over it and call the appropriate method.</p>
<p>Speaking of iteration, I need to be able to figure out the start and stop of my iterations...</p>
<p>Lets say, they give me 2,4 through 5,6. This means that I from 2,4 to 2,999, the to 3,0 to 3,999, 4,0 to 4,999, then 5,0 to 5,6. Wait, I don't think I read that properly...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square. The lights all start turned off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposite corners! So 0,0 through 2,2 is 0,0 | 0,1 | 1,2 | 1,0 | 1,1 | 1,2 | 2,0 | 2,1 | 2,2.</p>
<p>This means that 2,4 through 5,6 is 2,4 | 2,5 | 2,6 | 3,4 | 3,5 | 3,6 | 4,4 | 4,5 | 4,6 | 5,4 | 5,5 | 5,6.</p>
<p>In the above cases 2..=5, 4..=6.</p>
<p>Note:
I thing the coordinates are (y, x) in the above case because <code>Vec[y][x]</code>, but, since we only care about the number of lights on, I think I can get away with using <code>Vec[x][y]</code>.</p>
<p>They are giving us opposite corners of the rectangle. All of the example are bottom left corner to top right corner, but I do not know if all the inputs are these corners in this order.</p>
<ul>
<li>I took a quick glance at the inputs, and I think they are all bottom left to top right.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that I can for like:</p>
<pre><code>for x in 2..=5:
  for y in 4..=6:
     vec[x][y] = vec[x][y].&lt;command&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I will try to write it up, but it is getting late, so I do not know if I will finish it tonight.</p>

<p>It took longer than I thought to write, but it wasn't that bad. To make the program less confusing, I decided to keep the coordinates as (x1, y1), (x2, y2). Outside of that, some annoying things were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indecing on a Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;.
<ul>
<li>In Rust, we cannot use negative indexes to get the items of that end of the Vec</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Parsing the coordinates:
<ul>
<li>I had to make sure their type was usize so that I can use them when indexing the grid.</li>
<li>Also, the long string of methods I used to actually parse the &amp;str to usize was annoying. Cloning &amp;str clones the pointer and not the value, so I converted to a String, but Strings do not have a split method. So I converted the String to str and then did the split and parse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The program is long! I did not like how long this is.</li>
</ul>
